            <h3>Upstate Golisano and Our Families</h3>
            <p>Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital has been changing lives for the past 10 years!
                Each and every day there are miracles being made within the hospital and OttoTHON helps make these miracles possible.
                6 years ago, OttoTHON was founded on Syracuse University's campus and has been growing ever since.
                The money raised from the dance marathon event goes to the families in need at Upstate.
                Below are a few of our miracle kids and families. These are kids who have been or are being treated at Upstate
                and have become part of the OttoTHON family.

                        <div><h4><strong>The Miller's</strong></h4></div>
                        <p>Mason Miller is a bright and energetic 8 year old. When Mason was 5 years old he lacerated his spleen
                        while running around with his brother and cousins. He was treated in Upstate Golisano Children/s Hospital's 
                        Pediactric ICU for a few weeks. Since his injury, Mason now has a clean bill of health! He and his brother Lincoln
                        have come to OttoTHON for the past 2 years and are excited for their third event in the fall. The Miller's are extremly
                        greatful for the the nurses and doctors at the hospital that help Mason have a successful recovery.

                <div><h4><strong>The Lambert's</strong></h4></div>
                        <p>Evan Lambert is 7 years old and loves his friends from OttoTHON! He and his sister, Mia, enjoy
                            coming to Syracuse to dance for the kids at Upstate. As a baby, Evan faced complications during birth
                            due to lack of amniotic fluid. 7 years later, he is a loving, goofy, and happy kid. The Lambert's love Upstate's
                            welcoming and comfertable enviroment. Even when times were tough, they were able to escape their relatity through
                            the music therapy classes and family dinners that the hospital provides for patients. These opportunities would
                            not be possibly for families if it weren't for the money raised by OttoTHON, which is why the Lambert's are 
                            the organization's number one fans!

                <div><h4><strong>The Anderson's</strong></h4></div>
                        <p>Abby Anderson is OttoTHON's first miracle kid! She has been apart of our organization since 2016 and looks 
                            forward to the event all year long. Abby was diagnosed with Osteogenesis Imperfecta, a brittle bone disease cause
                            by mutations that affect every part of her body. She also deals with clubfeet, hearing impairments, and microcephalic.
                            The Anderson's do not let any of this impact their spirits! With freqeunt trips to Upstate, they have become close with
                            a lot of the hospital staff and make sure Abby is in the best care.
