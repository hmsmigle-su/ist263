                    Children's Miracle Network Hospitals is a non-profit organization that rasies money for Children's Hospitals
                    across America. They promote the education of children's health issues and medical research. Not every hospital
                    is a CMN Hospital, but lucky enough, Upstate Golisano is one of the hundreds of CMN Hospitals.
                    Dance Marathon events are put on by colleges all across the country and a lot of them are partenered with
                    a Children's Miracle Network. Want to find your local Children's Miracle Network Hosptial? Visit the Offical CMNH Website by following this <a href="https://mfch.childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/" target="CMNH Website">link</a>!

                       Miracle Network was founded in 1983 and raised money for 22 hospitals across the United States.
                       The organization was able to raise $4.8 million in its first year! In 1984, 13 year old Ryan White recieved a bad
                       blood transfusion and was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. The summer going into his freshman year at Indiana University,
                       Ryan White passed away. In his memory, his friends put toghether the first college dance marathon at Indiana University.
                       This was the begining of dance marathon partenering with Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. As years passed more and more universities
                       joined the movement, raising money for their local Children's Miracle Network Hospital. If you are interested in learning
