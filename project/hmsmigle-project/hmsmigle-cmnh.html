                <h3>Children's Mircale Network Hospitals</h3>
                <p> Children's Miracle Network Hospitals is a non-profit organization that rasies money for Children's Hospitals
                    across America. They promote the education of children's health issues and medical research. Not every hospital
                    is a CMN Hospital, but lucky enough, Upstate Golisano is one of the hundreds of CMN Hospitals.
                    Dance Marathon events are put on by colleges all across the country and a lot of them are partenered with
                    a Children's Miracle Network.
