            <h2>Upstate Golisano and Our Families</h2>
            <p>Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital has been changing lives for the past 10 years!
                Each and every day there are miracles being made within the hospital and OttoTHON helps make these miracles possible.
                6 years ago, OttoTHON was founded on Syracuse University's campus and has been growing ever since.
                The money raised from the dance marathon event goes to the families in need at Upstate.
                Below are a few of our miracle kids and families. These are kids who have been or are being treated at Upstate
                and have become part of the OttoTHON family.
