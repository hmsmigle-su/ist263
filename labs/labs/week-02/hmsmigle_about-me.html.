<body>
    <p> My name is Hayley Smigley and I am from Doylestown, PA.
    I am a junior at Syracuse University majoring in Information Management 
    and Technology with a minor in Information Technology Design 
    and Start-Ups. I am currenlty looking to concentrate in either 
    Data Analytics or Project Management.<p>

    <p>On campus I am mainly involved within two organizations. Since freshman
    year, I have been a player on the Syracuse Women's Club Soccer Team.
    The team has allowed me to continue to competitively play soccer
    through my college career while focusing on academics.
    Another organization I am involved in is OttoTHON, which is a 12 hour
    dance marathon that raises money for children at Upstate. Through this
    organization I am the Internal Events and Operations Director.<p>
